About me
------
I'm a Third-year postgraduate student at [School of Global Health](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sghen/About/SGH.htm), Chinese Center for Tropical Diseases Research, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), China. I received my Bachelor of Medicine degree in the School of Public Health, [Anhui Medical University](https://english.ahmu.edu.cn/). My research interests are Next Generation Sequencing, Public Health, Bioinformatics and Machine Learning. See my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xy1ZOE_R70Ij-LB78fU0swIOhcjfUKYI/view?usp=sharing). I'm currently applying for Ph.D. positions.

The role of livestock in the emergence and dissemination of infectious disease in humans is a threat the is yet to be fully unravelled. This is because linking human disease to animal source is usually retrospectively done through source tracking part of outbreak investigation and even so, inferences are based on geographic and molecular homology. In reality, there are remarkably few studies holistically examining this relation outside outbreak conditions. In this application we propose a unique study design and epidemiological environment to sample humans, livestock, migratory and non-migratory wild life. To develop a high-resolution pipeline for sampling, processing and analyzing clinical, occupational health samples to support diagnostics and preparedness on Chongming island, shotgun metagenomic sequencing offers the specific resolution needed to resolve contact and pathogen transmission between humans, animals and their environment.

In the entire ecosystem, rich diversities of microorganisms exist at the human-animal interface, some of which cause human and/or animal diseases. There are 58% of human pathogens that are zoonotic and cause diseases in both humans and animals. The food safety of livestock is a critical issue between animals and humans due to their complex interactions. Pathogens have the potential to spread at every stage of the animal food handling process, including breeding, processing, packaging, storage, transportation, marketing and consumption. In addition, application of the antibiotic usage in domestic animals is a controversial issue because, while they can combat food-borne zoonotic pathogens and promote animal growth and productivity, they can also lead to the transmission of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and antibiotic-resistant genes across species and habitats. Coevolution of microbiomes may occur in humans and animals as well which may alter the structure of the human microbiome through animal food consumption. One Health is a holistic approach to systematically understand the complex relationships among humans, animals and environments which may provide effective countermeasures to solve food safety problems aforementioned. This paper depicts the main pathogen spectrum of livestock and animal products, summarizes the flow of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes between humans and livestock along the food-chain production, and the correlation of their microbiome is reviewed as well to advocate for deeper interdisciplinary communication and collaboration among researchers in medicine, epidemiology, veterinary medicine and ecology to promote One Health approaches to address the global food safety challenges.
