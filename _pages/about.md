About me
======
Hi! I am a third-year master student at [School of Global Health](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sghen/About/SGH.htm), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english). I received my Bachelor of Medicine in the School of Public Health, [Anhui Medical University](https://english.ahmu.edu.cn/). I'm currently looking for Ph.D. positions starting 2024 Fall in the U.S. and Europe.

My research interests are next generation sequencing, public health, bioinformatics, and machine learning. See my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xy1ZOE_R70Ij-LB78fU0swIOhcjfUKYI/view?usp=sharing). If you are interested in any research collaboration with me, drop me an email and I would love to chat.

+ **Mapping microbial connectivity of people, animals and their environment. [Left-highres](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GZnsrNatXDrxWZX9U0QeRD4sF9_KQ9X-/view?usp=sharing) [Right-highres](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-SYHXCjU_5uRPG7FU51wi_iiyd4x3NiK/view?usp=drive_link)**

+ We propose a unique study design and epidemiological environment to sample workers, pigs and soil from 5 farms. Our analytical pipeline includes genome assembly programs, taxonomic classifiers, read mappers, and pathway reconstruction tools. This hybrid assembly approach has lower error rates, produces more contiguous assemblies, generates metagenomic assembled genomes, and allows for the reconstruction of near-complete genomes.

+ In the entire ecosystem, rich diversities of microorganisms exist at the human-animal interface, some of which cause human and/or animal diseases. There are 58% of human pathogens that are zoonotic and cause diseases in both humans and animals. The food safety of livestock is a critical issue between animals and humans due to their complex interactions. Pathogens have the potential to spread at every stage of the animal food handling process, including breeding, processing, packaging, storage, transportation, marketing and consumption. In addition, application of the antibiotic usage in domestic animals is a controversial issue because, while they can combat food-borne zoonotic pathogens and promote animal growth and productivity, they can also lead to the transmission of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and antibiotic-resistant genes across species and habitats. Coevolution of microbiomes may occur in humans and animals as well which may alter the structure of the human microbiome through animal food consumption. One Health is a holistic approach to systematically understand the complex relationships among humans, animals and environments which may provide effective countermeasures to solve food safety problems aforementioned. This paper depicts the main pathogen spectrum of livestock and animal products, summarizes the flow of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes between humans and livestock along the food-chain production, and the correlation of their microbiome is reviewed as well to advocate for deeper interdisciplinary communication and collaboration among researchers in medicine, epidemiology, veterinary medicine and ecology to promote One Health approaches to address the global food safety challenges.
