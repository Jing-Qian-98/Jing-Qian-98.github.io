Hello, I'm Jing
======

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [the Department of Integrative Physiology](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/), [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/), where I am fortunate to work with [Dr. Matthew R. Olm](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/matthew-r-olm) at [the Integrative Microbiome Research Laboratory](https://live-ucbdev-lab-olm.pantheonsite.io/). Our research focuses on  understanding the dynamics of human microbiome, particularly:
- The transmission and acquisition patterns of human microbiota
- The role of gut microbiome in early-life immune system development and disease
- The complex interactions between intestinal immunity and microbiome in health and disease

Previously, I completed my Master of Medicine at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english), where I worked on antibiotic resistance genes and One Health surveillance. I received my Bachelor of Medicine from [Anhui Medical University](https://english.ahmu.edu.cn/).

I am always excited to discuss science and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email!
