This paper summarizes the main modes of transmission and the relationship between them and outlines Chinese and other countries' national plans to combat antibiotic resistance. We advocate that countries and regions use the concept and method of One Health to control the spread of antibiotic resistance. In addition, we should deal with the global challenge of antibiotic resistance through multisectoral collaboration among the medical and health sectors, food and drug administration, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, husbandry, education, and finance.
